Dear ZBC-HTX-Programming teams(B/C),

I've recently started a python assignment which uses the chinook database.
The assignment that I'm stuck on is figuring out which album is listened to most.
Then, I need to write print the top 10 results with the name of the album and the artist,
and the number of times a track is played on the album.
Also, i need to fit all this into one query.
My attempt includes using PyCharm-EDU as IDE:
"""

#connection
"""The sqlite3 package below has to be installed by yourself, 
teherefore please 
- click on the Python Packages tab below 
- search for sqlite3 and install the package"""

import sqlite3
"""
run the code so far to ensure taht the package sqlite 3 is 
installed and enterpreted(understood) successfully"""

"""
You have to ensure that the code runs en a robust manner, 
this is done by encapsulating the connection commands into
try/exeption blocks implemented below 
"""
